<b>WeSplit</b> - project 1 of 100 Days of SwiftUI by Paul Hudson (link [here](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/books/ios-swiftui/wesplit-introduction))

The app is a check-splitting app that you might use after eating at a restaurant – you enter the cost of your food, select how much of a tip you want to leave, and how many people you’re with, and it will tell you how much each person needs to pay.

At the end of the guided tutorial, there are some challenges that are implemented by myself (without Paul's guidance). They will be in separate commits, one for each challenge.

<p><b>Challenge #1</b>: Add a header to the third section, saying “Amount per person”</p>

<p><b>Challenge #2</b>: Add another section showing the total amount for the check – i.e., the original amount plus tip value, without dividing by the number of people.</p>

<p><b>Challenge #3</b>: Change the tip percentage picker to show a new screen rather than using a segmented control, and give it a wider range of options – everything from 0% to 100%</p>
